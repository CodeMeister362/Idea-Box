# Idea Box  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The creative process can be difficult for even the most experienced artists and writers. Idea Box works to make this process easier by allowing users to save, favorite, and search through their past ideas.

### Installation Instructions:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We faced technical challenges with the search bar functionality, specifically figuring out the appropriate DRY functions needed to display only the correct cards, regardless of whether you are starting from the "view all ideas" page or the "view saved ideas" page. Matching the CSS comp for dynamic viewports also took trial and error. To resolve these, we leaned on our groupmates for additional eyes and fresh ideas. Our group consisted of four people living in four different USA time zones, all contributing to code across three files, so we relied on daily standups and our PR messages to share updates and problem-solve.
